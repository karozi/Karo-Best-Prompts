# Karo's Best Prompts
The prompt vault I actually use (and that built all of my projects).


## 📖 About This Repo
This is not another “1,000+ ChatGPT prompts” dump, it's my personal, battle-tested prompt collection.

I refined over hundreds of real-life tests, experiments, and actual shipped products.

Every prompt here has been:

🧪 Tested in real projects — from AI product design to automation flows.

🎯 Optimized for clarity — so you get useful, relevant output without guesswork.

🛠 Built to be remixed — plug them into ChatGPT, Claude, Replit Agents and other tools.

## 🚀 How to Use
Browse → Open any .md file to explore prompt examples.

Copy → Paste into your AI tool of choice.

Customize → Swap placeholders for your project context.

Run & Iterate → Try a prompt and make it your own if needed. 

## 🏆 Why These Work

Advanced context engineering, testing & evaluation → Each prompt is stress-tested in real scenarios, with structured input/output checks to ensure it performs reliably across tools, topics, and edge cases.

Context-first → Gives the AI enough background to sound smart.

Step-by-step reasoning → Forces depth instead of fluff.

Constraints → Narrow scope = higher quality output.

Tone control → The AI matches your style, not the other way around.
